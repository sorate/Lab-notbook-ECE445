## 02/15/2022 - Researching Ways to Load models onto Microcontrollers <a name = "begin"></a>

Beginning research on ways to load CNN for image classification onto a microcontroller. Initial model building is beginning now so that memory requirements can be considered when the microcontroller is finally ordered.

Image processing will also need to be thought of because all images fed into the model need to be the same size to reduce variance.

## 02/20/2022 - Starting Research on different types of cmaeras and cameras that work with simple communication interfaces <a name = "camera"></a>

Might be a possible camera but it doesn't have the best resolution and pixel accuracy. We need relatively high pixel accuracy in order for the model to predict things correctly.

# 02/15/2022 - Researching Ways to Load models onto Microcontrollers <a name = "begin"></a>

Beginning research on ways to load CNN for image classification onto a microcontroller. Initial model building is beginning now so that memory requirements can be considered when the microcontroller is finally ordered.

Image processing will also need to be thought of because all images fed into the model need to be the same size to reduce variance.
